# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for taking the time to improve this project! ðŸŽ‰


## ðŸ”’ Branch Protection
- **`main` is protected**: no direct or force pushes.
- All changes come via a **Pull Request (PR)**.
- A **Code Owner** must approve every PR.
- We enforce a linear historyâ€”prefer **Squash & Merge**.


## ðŸš€ Typical Workflow
1. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/short-description
   ```
2. **Commit your work** with clear messages.
3. **Push and open a PR** targeting `main`.
   - Describe _what_ and _why_.
   - Reference issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`) if it is created.
4. **Wait for Code Owner approval** and ensure checks are green.
5. **Merge** once checks are green and approval is granted.


## âœ¨ Code Style
We prefer code that is:
- **Clear**: easy to read and understand.
- **Documented**: methods, classes, functions and complex logic should include brief comments.
- **Consistent**: follow existing patterns and formatting
